# pytcnz example files

This directory contains example files to be used with pytcnz:

* `tc-export-demo.xls` — exported data from [TournamentControl](https://tournamentcontrol.dtkapiti.co.nz/) using entirely fictitious data.
* `tc-export-demo-maker.xls` — the source of the data file, using functions to compute some of the data, but the scripts cannot read it directly, so sheets have to copy-pasted *as values only* into the example file.
